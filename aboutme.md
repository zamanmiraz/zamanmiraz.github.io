## Experience
### **Louisiana Tech University** 
*Graduate Assistant (December'2017 - December'2020 & September'2021 - Now)*
- Develop a post-quantum Hash algorithm/Pseudo-random number generator using Isogeny based Elliptic Curve Cryptography. Design and test the algorithm using the computational algebra system Sage, and Magma. Analyze
the data using Pandas, NumPy.
- Set up, Manage, and Operate Racked server for research and computational purpose.
- Survey and Review thoroughly the literature of Isogeny based Elliptic Curve Cryptography.
- Design Blockchain Consensus architectures that can solve real-world applications. Build and test the prototypes of the designed Blockchain architecture using Python 2.7, Gambit 16.0.1. Analyze and compare the performance with R programming and Python modules.
- Develop a Hash generation algorithm for arbitrary sized and shape hierarchical structures using parallel computing.
Implement the developed algorithm in Python 3.7. Test the algorithm through functional and non-functional testing.
- Evaluate and grade student (Grad. & Undergrad) performance and tabulate results.
- Coordinate meetings with students and make tutorials to explain the lectures and homework.

### **Infobeyond Technology LLC** 
*Graduate Research Intern (January'2021 - September'2021)*
- Design and Implement Intel SGX Based applications in Intel(R) SGX SDK, SCONE Docker, and OCCLUM OS.
Analyze the performance of implemented applications in a different environment.
- Implement Hyperledger Fabric Blockchain in Intel SGX environment to create a distributed architecture for storing
and delivering grid data using Docker Container.
- Design and Implement API for SGX Based application using Java Spring REST framework.
- Research and Identify possible SGX based applications and make documentation.

### **Prime University** 
*Lecturer in Dept. of Electrical & Electronic Engineering (February'2015 - July'2017)*
- Draft and design course modules for courses, i.e., MATLAB Programming for Beginners, Electrical Circuit Design. Conduct laboratories, quizzes, and exams. Grade and Tabulate exam results.
- Teach courses Data Structures and Algorithms, Object Oriented Programming, Electrical Circuits.
