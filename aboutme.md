### **Infobeyond Technology LLC**
*Louisville, KY, USA*
*Graduate Research Intern (January 2021 - September 2021)*
- **Designing and Implementing Intel SGX-Based Applications**: I was responsible for conceptualizing and creating applications leveraging Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) technology. These applications were developed using the Intel(R) SGX Software Development Kit (SDK) and were optimized for security and data privacy. The development environment included SCONE Docker and OCCLUM OS, which allowed for secure and isolated execution. My role extended to designing, coding, and thoroughly testing these applications to ensure their reliability and security.
- **Performance Analysis of SGX-Based Applications**: Following the development phase, I conducted in-depth performance analysis of these SGX-based applications. This analysis involved assessing how the applications behaved in various computing environments and under different conditions. By scrutinizing their performance metrics, I aimed to identify areas for improvement and optimization.
- **Implementing Hyperledger Fabric Blockchain in SGX Environment**: As part of my responsibilities, I implemented the Hyperledger Fabric Blockchain framework within the secure enclave provided by Intel SGX. This integration was designed to create a robust and distributed architecture tailored for the storage and delivery of grid data. Docker Containers were utilized to ensure portability and scalability, making the solution well-suited for real-world applications in data management and security.
- **Designing and Implementing SGX-Based API**: I was tasked with designing and developing application programming interfaces (APIs) specifically tailored for SGX-based applications. This involved using the Java Spring REST framework to create secure and efficient communication interfaces that would enable seamless interaction with the SGX-enabled services and applications.
- **Research and Documentation on SGX-Based Applications**: My role also encompassed extensive research to identify potential applications that could benefit from Intel SGX technology. This research included exploring use cases, assessing security requirements, and evaluating the feasibility of SGX integration. Additionally, I documented my findings and recommendations, providing valuable insights for future SGX-based projects and initiatives.

### **Prime University** 
*Dhaka, Bangladesh*
*Lecturer in Dept. of Electrical & Electronic Engineering (February 2015 - July 2017)*
- **Course Material Development**: I took on the responsibility of designing and developing comprehensive course materials for multiple subjects. Specifically, I created structured curriculum content for courses like "MATLAB Programming for Beginners" and "Electrical Circuit Design." This process involved carefully outlining the course objectives, organizing the syllabus, and creating engaging learning resources such as lecture notes, assignments, and supplementary materials. The aim was to provide students with a clear and effective learning path to grasp these subjects.
- **Laboratory Facilitation**: In addition to course material development, I actively facilitated laboratory sessions for the aforementioned courses. During these sessions, I guided students through practical exercises and experiments related to MATLAB programming and electrical circuit design. I ensured that students had a hands-on learning experience, providing them with the opportunity to apply theoretical concepts to real-world scenarios.
- **Assessment Administration**: As part of my role, I administered regular quizzes and examinations to evaluate students' understanding of the course content. These assessments were thoughtfully designed to cover a range of topics and gauge the depth of comprehension. Following the assessments, I meticulously assessed and recorded students' exam scores, maintaining accurate records of their academic progress.
- **Lecture Delivery**: I was responsible for delivering engaging and informative lectures on various subjects. These included lectures on fundamental topics such as "Data Structures and Algorithms," "Object-Oriented Programming," and "Electrical Circuits." My approach focused on conveying complex concepts in a clear and accessible manner, fostering an environment conducive to learning and knowledge retention.
