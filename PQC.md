## Supersingular Isogney
* **Supersingular Isogeny-Based Single Compression Cryptographic Hash Function**: The paper is accepted in 2023 IEEE Global Communications Conference: Communication & Information Systems Security. The proposed work offers following properties.
  * *Novel Single Compression Hash Function*: Introducing an innovative single compression cryptographic hash function.
  * *Supersingular Isogeny Foundation*: Built upon the traversal of the supersingular isogeny (2-isogeny) graph and point mapping under isogeny.
  * *Enhanced Security*: Unlike existing approaches, the proposed function conceals the curve's j-invariant, posing two formidable challenges to attackers: identifying the curve from its X-coordinate and solving the supersingular isogeny problem.
  * *Improved Preimage Resistance*: Significantly bolstered preimage resistance.
  * *Collision-Free Assurance*: The function inherently ensures a collision-free property through the random mapping of different points or isogenies to the same point.
  * *Efficient Processing*: The compression function efficiently processes bits from multiple message blocks in a single step, reducing computational complexity.
  * *Parallelization Resilience*: Organically modifies the message to resist parallelization attempts.
  * *Comparative Analysis*: In-depth computational complexity analysis compared to CGL and CGL-like hash functions.
