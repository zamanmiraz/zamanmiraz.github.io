I am a PhD candidate of Computational Analysis and at Louisiana Tech Univesity 
I am currently a second year PhD student, part of the [CDT for Cybersecurity](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/cybersecurity-cdt/) and the [Information Security group](https://sec.cs.ucl.ac.uk/) at University College London. My main interests are post-quantum cryptography, specifically isogeny-based protocols and applications.
My main supervisors are [Philipp Jovanovic](https://philipp.jovanovic.io/) and [Sarah Meiklejohn](https://smeiklej.com/). 

Before starting my PhD, I completed my Undergraduate and Master's degree in Mathematics at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/), specialising in Algebraic Number Theory and Elliptic Curves.


I am passionate about communicating cryptography and mathematics to others, and have written a series of [blog posts on isogeny-based cryptography](https://mariascrs.github.io/posts.html), as well as giving a number of outreach [talks](https://mariascrs.github.io/talks.html) to STEM students.
