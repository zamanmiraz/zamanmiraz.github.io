<p style='text-align: justify;'> I am Miraz Uz Zaman, a passionate individual with a strong background in Computational Analysis and Modeling. Holding a PhD in Computational Analysis & Modeling with a CGPA of 3.82 from Louisiana Tech University, I have been dedicated to pursuing excellence in the field. My academic journey also includes an MS in Computer Science with a CGPA of 3.81 from the same institution and a Bachelor of Science in Electrical & Electronic Engineering from Khulna University of Engineering & Technology, Bangladesh, with a CGPA of 3.63.
My professional experience has spanned both research and industry. I have been a Research Scientist at Infobeyond Technology LLC in Louisville, KY since July 2023, contributing to the prototyping and development of research projects. I have also held roles as a Graduate Research Assistant at Louisiana Tech University, where I specialized in post-quantum cryptography and blockchain technology. I've been involved in the development of innovative cryptographic algorithms and blockchain consensus mechanisms, as well as implementing them in real-world applications.
Teaching has also been a significant part of my journey. As a Graduate Teaching Assistant at Louisiana Tech University, I engaged with students, evaluated their performance, and conducted tutorials to enhance their learning experience. At Prime University, Bangladesh, I served as a Lecturer, where I designed course modules and conducted classes on various subjects including Data Structures and Algorithms, Object-Oriented Programming, and Electrical Circuits.

My skills encompass a wide range of languages and tools, including Python, MySQL, R, Java, MATLAB, Git, Docker, and more. I'm comfortable working with Linux/Ubuntu and Windows operating systems.
My research and contributions have resulted in several publications, with topics ranging from blockchain consensus mechanisms to isogeny-based cryptography. I have also delivered talks and presentations at conferences, sharing insights into blockchain mechanisms and architectures.

In addition to my academic achievements, I have been recognized with awards such as the Louisiana Tech Graduate Tuition Scholarship and the Japanese Government (MEXT) Scholarship, which allowed me to study at Keio University, one of Japan's top private universities.

In summary, I am a dedicated researcher, educator, and technologist, driven by a passion for innovative solutions in computational analysis and modeling. My academic background, research, and practical experience have equipped me with a solid foundation to contribute effectively to various domains within the field. Feel free to reach out to me for any further information or collaboration opportunities.
