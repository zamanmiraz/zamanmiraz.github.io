  'm Miraz Uz Zaman, a computational analysis and modeling enthusiast. With a PhD in Computational Analysis & Modeling from Louisiana Tech University and an MS in Computer Science, I've delved deep into innovative research.

I've contributed to real-world projects as a Research Scientist at Infobeyond Technology LLC, focusing on prototyping and development. My research spans post-quantum cryptography, blockchain consensus mechanisms, and isogeny-based cryptography, resulting in notable publications and presentations.

Skilled in Python, Java, MATLAB, and more, I bring a strong technical aptitude to the table. I've also been recognized with awards like the Louisiana Tech Graduate Tuition Scholarship and the Japanese Government Scholarship.

My drive to innovate and contribute to cutting-edge solutions is what fuels me. I'm excited about opportunities to collaborate and make an impact in the world of Cryptography, Blockchain, and Security. Feel free to connect with me for any inquiries or collaborations.
